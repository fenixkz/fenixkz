# Hello, I'm Ayan Mazhitov!
I'm a robotics engineer who is passionate about robotics, control, and AI. I have experience working with various robotic systems, including manipulators, mobile robots, and humanoid robots. I'm also interested in the intersection of robotics and AI, and how we can leverage machine learning algorithms to enable robots to perceive and interact with their environment.

## What I'm currently working on
Investigating the use of various techniques (Diffusion Models, VLA) for object recognition and tracking using tactile sensing in robotics applications

Contributing to open-source robotics projects

## My projects
- [Cubic ASRS Simulation](https://github.com/fenixkz/automated_warehouse): A full simulation of ASRS system designed for E-Commerce projects. Handles multiple robots. 
- [Intro to RL](https://github.com/fenixkz/rl_journey): Contains own written series of lessons to serve as strong introduction to RL. Explores variety of topics from black-box optimizers to SoTA algorithms like PPO and SAC.
- [RAG-based chat bot for Kazakhstani Housing Law questions](https://github.com/fenixkz/kz_lawbot): A telegram hosted chat bot based on Saiga-Nemo russian speaking LLM for questions related to Kazakhstani Housing laws.
- [Mini-Dostoyevskiy](https://github.com/fenixkz/mini_dostoyevskiy): A fully written from scratch decoder only transformer (GPT) trained on Dostoyevskiy books to mimic his style.
- [Snake robot](https://github.com/fenixkz/ros_snake_robot): Simulated planar (2D) robot in Gazebo. Also incorporates control based on position/effort controllers with tuned PIDs, and MoveIt.
- [Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm](https://github.com/fenixkz/recursive-newton-euler-dynamics): MATLAB based implementation of recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for robot's dynamics.
- [ICub_Gazebo based Force Control](https://github.com/fenixkz/icub_gazebo_sensitivity): Force control for the index finger of ICub humanoid robot for tactile exploration purposes within YARP framework. 
- [Franka Emika robot's Cartesian control](https://github.com/fenixkz/franka_cartesian_control): ROS-based controller to control the robot in Cartesian space
- [Autonomous or manually controlled mobile robot](https://github.com/fenixkz/final_assignment/tree/noetic): This project features a Gazebo simulation of a mobile robot with a user interface that enables users to autonomously navigate the robot to specific coordinates, manually control the robot using the keyboard, or drive the robot while receiving collision avoidance assistance.
- [Mobile robot with RGB camera to inspect the environment](https://github.com/fenixkz/exprob_second_assignment): This project presents a Gazebo simulation of a mobile robot that employs an RGB camera for indoor environment inspection, the robot's behavior is controlled by a State Machine created using the SMACH library.
- [Autonomous mobile robot](https://github.com/fenixkz/rt_assigment2): This project is a ROS-Stage based simulation of an autonomous mobile robot successfully completing a circular path without colliding into walls.

## My publications
- [E-BTS: Event-Based Tactile Sensor for Haptic Teleoperation in Augmented Reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758224): The prompt and robust detection of tactile information is a relevant and challenging problem, and a considerable research effort is, thus, being put into innovative transduction methods for tactile sensors. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using event-based cameras to sense contact forces applied to objects by a robot end effector. 
- [Human–robot handover with prior-to-pass soft/rigid object classification via tactile glove](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889022002007): Human–robot handovers constitute a challenging and fundamental aspect of physical human–robot interaction. This paper describes the design and implementation of a human–robot handover pipeline in the case in which both soft and rigid objects are passed by the human to the robot.
- [Deformable object recognition using proprioceptive and exteroceptive tactile sensing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8700392): The somatosensory sense is a combination of several perception systems. It plays an important role in the exploration and recognition of the environment. In this work, we show how proprioceptive (internal) and exteroceptive (external) sensing can help to distinguish deformable and rigid objects
